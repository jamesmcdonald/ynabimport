# Cook data from skandiabanken for import into YNAB.  Entirely based on
# guesswork and reverse-engineering from failures, so ymmv.

# To use this, follow these steps:

# Go to Kontoutskrift and select the date range you're interested in. It
# doesn't work very well with 'Siste 30 dager' because there are usually
# uncleared junk transactions at the top that just say 'VarekjÃ¸p'. I usually do
# from a couple of days before the last import until yesterday.

# Click 'Last ned', 'CSV'
# Select the defaults:
#   Skilletegn: Semikolon
#   Decimaltegn: Komma
# Click 'Last ned CSV'

# You need to run this script from a terminal. On Linux or MacOS, you should be
# fine; on Windows you'll need to install cygwin or msys or something to get
# perl and iconv.

# Run this script on the CSV, something like:
#   perl ~/Downloads/ynabimport.pl 8888888888_2016_07_12-2016_08_05.csv | iconv -f iso-8859-1 > ~/Desktop/import.csv
# (the iconv bit is necessary because the file is in ISO-8859-1 format, and YNAB likes UTF-8)

# Just drag the resulting import.csv from your desktop into YNAB! You will need
# to mess around with the payee names. At the moment the support for payee name
# matching in new YNAB is pretty weak.

use strict;
print "Date,Payee,Category,Memo,Outflow,Inflow\n";

# Field separator in the bank export
my $FS=";";
# Expect CR as well as LF
$/="\r\n";
# Separate print output with a comma
$,=',';

while(<>) {
    chomp;
    s/"//g;
    s/,/./g;
    my @F = split($FS);
    if (scalar(@F) > 0 && $F[0] =~ /(\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})/) {
        $F[0] =~ s@(\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})@$3/$2/$1@;
        # If we have a 'credit' value, stick it in the 'debit' column as a negative
        my $val = scalar(@F)==7 && $F[6] ne ''?'-'.$F[6]:$F[5];
        print $F[0], $F[4], "", "", $val . "\n";
    }
}
